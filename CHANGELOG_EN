EdXposed 0.5.x.x support (build 4653+ is required):
	Module's settings will be migrated to work with new EdXposed Framework version on first module UI launch.
	It is recommended to make a backup using built-in function before updating.
	Old settings could still be loaded by disabling EdXposed Framework or downgrading it to 0.4.x.x.
	Launching any app on device can have an additional delay depending on the number of active mods.
	It's a result of how new EdXposed loads modules, this cannot be avoided without breaking some system mods.
