<u>Common poblems</u><br><br>

<i>Module and mods were activated, device rebooted, but none of the mods are working.</i>
<hr>
Go to (Ed)Xposed Installer > Log and check information there.<br>
Find line "Loading modules from .../name.mikanoshi.customiuizer/...".<br>
If next line contains "File does not exist", then just reinstall CustoMIUIzer.<br>
If next line contains "This class requires resource-related hooks (which are disabled), skipping it.", then open (Ed)Xposed Installer > Settings and uncheck experimental option "Disabled resource hooks".<br>
If next line contains something else (error, exception, etc), then send detailed report from CustoMIUIzer and hope it can be fixed :)
