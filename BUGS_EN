Known bugs:

- Module settings might crash on Android 8-8.1, seems to be a bug in EdXposed that breaks all the module's resources. Module must be deactivated (and device rebooted) to change any settings. You can also install module's APK on top and it should be able to open settings until next reboot.

- Latest versions of some Xiaomi apps are obfuscated and are not compatible with mods in this module (never will be)

- Text color in some popup lists and menus is too dark when dark mode is active on device; on Android versions below 9 dark mode can be incomplete
